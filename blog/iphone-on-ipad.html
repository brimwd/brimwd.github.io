<h1>iPhone Apps Are Still Gross On iPad (and four ways Apple could improve)<h1>
<h2>Every Product Has Band-aids; Don't forget to rip them off</h2>

<p>In the decade since Apple released the iPad, there's one particularly gross "feature" that's been neglected in update after update. I'm speaking, of course, of the gross way that iPads handle iPhone apps.</p>
<p>Let's start from the beginning... Before the Retina Display "made everything blocky" or the iPhone 4's "AntennaGate" prompted Apple to give out free silicon bumpers, we had the early App Store. At the time, all of the mere 100,000 apps in the were made for tiny little original-iPhone screens. The iPad, with it's larger and more-square display, simply couldn't render the iPhone apps full-screen without stretching or cropping them.</p>
<p>While Apple waited for the developer community to build apps tailored for the iPad, they decided to band-aid the problem of "there are no apps for iPad" by simply centering the iPhone apps in the middle of the iPad screen. It's not the most elegant fix, but it worked and Apple had faith that the developers would come through.</p>
<p>With your iPhone app sitting awkwardly in the middle of your screen, you have two options: By default the apps will render at "1X" (the original resolution as you would see on an iPhone) or by tapping a little button in the bottom right corner you could switch to "2X" (technically '4x' because the app would run at twice the width and twice the height), and it would mostly fill the screen in portrait-mode.</p>

<p>The weird thing is, even when you hit (2X) to scale the app up, it still doesn't scale up like one would expect. Instead of stretching to 100% in one direction and letterboxing the other (like every other screen will do automatically with content for a different aspect ratio), Apple opted to letterbox all four sides.</p>

<blockquote class="sms">Why, Apple, why?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="sms">Oh wait, I know!</blockquote>

<p>This probably made a lot of sense back in 2010 given the difference between iPhone and iPad's aspect-ratios and resolutions. 2x was as big as you could scale an app and still come out with an even number of pixels, which was important to keep apps from appearing blurry or distorted.</p>

<p>Now it's been a decade and most apps I use on my iPad these days are built specifically for iPad, but every once in a while I'll decide to check on my bank account or really do anything outside of my artificially-created bubble of iPad-supporting apps and I'm jolted back to reality, wondering why Apple never revisited this experience - not even with the 2019 release of iPad OS, "the OS made just for iPad".</p>
<p>Enough exposition; Let's take a peek at Robinhood, the Millennial-friendly, no-fees stock-trading app that's saved Apple's market cap in 2020 to see how optimistic I should feel about an early retirement.

<blockquote class="sms">Oh my god, everything's gone sideways! At least they gave me this little '2X' button so I can double my money.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="sms">Nope, that didn't help either.</blockquote>

<p>Given Apple's reputation for "magical" UX, you'd be forgiven for assuming that I'm the idiot here and I've simply locked my screen orientation and forgotten about it, but I really haven't.</p>
<p>Now I've been an Apple-apologizer for years, making all manner of excuses for why they're late to release some critical features or why they're entitled to make other seemingly bad or incongruous choices, but I just can't see the justification here.</p>
<p>With all of the technological progress and the fact that even the iPad Mini (with its "diminutive" resolution of 2048-by-1536 at 326 ppi) still has more than enough real-estate to render iPhone apps "sideways" so they can appear upright while using your iPad in landscape (as you would with a keyboard).</p>

<p>At the time the iPad was released, Apple seemed convinced that developers would flock to the opportunity to build all-new apps for iPad. History has demonstrated the contrary, however; Whether it was the lack of financial incentive (because Apple promised consumers that developers would do the work for free), or because the iPad's underwhelming sales figures<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup> left companies focused on greener pastures â€” I'll never know.</p>
<p>What I do know is that it's high time the iOS / iPad OS team address this UX blunder so that it can become a footnote in the history of 'the legendary success of another Apple product'.</p>
<p>Here's some inspirational crap for any designers who might be looking for a lesson in all of this: My advice to you is to <strong>take notes as you do your work</strong>, be honest about your design's problem-areas, and revisit the ugly solutions from time to time.</p>
<p>I think the lesson in all of this is to take detailed notes as you do your work; Be honest about your design's problem-areas, and revisit the ugly solutions from time to time.</p>
<p>Products, markets, people, and minds change; Old technical constraints shouldn't limit your future. If you're open and honest about the compromises you made, you'll be better equipped to remedy those disappointments when the opportunities arise.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">Don't let band-aids become "the way we've always done things".</blockquote>

<p>Finally, for anyone at Apple who might come across this, I have four easy options for potential solutions that there might still be time to squeeze into the next release of iPad OS.</p>

<img src="Option-1.png" title="Option 1: render iPhone apps using the 'Slide Over' feature" />
<img src="Option-2.png" title="Option 2: render iPhone apps in Split-View with the option to add another app for multitasking" />
<img src="Option-3.png" title="Option 3: simplify upgrading iPhone apps with default iPad templates" />
<img src="Option-4.png" title="Option 4: require developers to produce a landscape layout appropriate for iPad as a condition for continuing their relationship with Apple" />

<p>I hope this inspires you to keep doing your best work and stay humble, my friend.</p>
