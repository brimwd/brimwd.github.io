# UX? That's basically UI, right?

"Yes and no." You'll probably hear me say that a lot. 

User Interface (or UI, as it's often shortened to) is all about the look and feel of your service. UI is the colors, the images, the size of your buttons, and the style of your type. UI is kind of like a person's clothes. You can change your outfit and dress up for an interview or a date, or you can wear something loose and comfortable to go skateboarding with your friends. Each outfit (each UI) has its own function, and it's up to your UI designer to figure out who your "customer" is. A great UI designer knows how to strike exactly the right balance so you aren't overdressed or sending the wrong signals.

To that end, UI is certainly a component of 'User eXperience' (UX), but there's more to a good experience than the interface, and successful companies capitalize on it.

# Okay, so then what's UX?

Good question. UX can be difficult to pin down, so let's see if we can first work out what it's not.

Keeping with our clothes analogy, if UI is the outfit, what of the person underneath?

While two different people can wear the same outfit, it's probably gonna fit a little funny. Most of that comes down to what our bodies do and how we use them. 

My legs, long and slender though they may be, are not going to get the same mileage out of my girlfriend's miniskirt as hers are. In web terms, that's more about "Back-End" than UX, but it's an important distinction to make.

# Now I'm confused. What's left?

Stripping away functionality and UI, you might appear to have two very similar products. Bear with me as we dive into my clothing analogy one more time.

What's the difference between twin siblings wearing the same outfit? **Hopefully** they have different names, but there's more to it than that. Each twin has his or her own personality; their own body language, tastes, mannerisms, attitude, relationships, and all the rest.

# Personality is king

In the high-stakes, cut-throat world of today's market, sometimes the only thing you can do to set yourself apart is smile.

Outfits can change; with hard, painstaking work, body types can change; but your personality still makes or breaks you.

It's not too difficult to carve out an acceptable UX; most UI designers can get you part of the way, but to make something really special takes something more.

Just like a great personality can carry you to the heights of society, so too can a great UX can carry your product into the hearts of your customers, onto their social media accounts, into their offices, and into their corporate licensing plans.

# Cool! So what exactly is UX?

Your UX is really up to your product, your customers, and your stakeholders to define. The important part is that you make sure you never stop asking if you can serve your customers better or make your service easier - the rest you can pick up on the way.
