	<h1>On Being Data-Driven to the Exclusion of Intuition</h1>
	<h2>4 (illustrated) minutes to better collaboration with designers</h2>
	<!-- <p><time datetime="2019-09-13">Sep 13, 2019</time> • 4 min read</p> -->

	<p class="my-5">I was inspired to write this article after reading a great opinion piece by Kerry Clark on <a href="http://designtimes.blogspot.com/2019/01/why-justifying-design-decisions-may-not.html" target="_blank">justifying design decisions</a>. Before I get into it, here&#8217;s a quick overview of &#8216;Design Rationale&#8217; that I&#8217;ve largely plagiarized from Wikipedia:</p>

	<p><span class="dropcap">In</span> 1970 W.R. Kunz and Horst Rittel&#8217;s work on the Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) led to a formal approach to justifying designs. That approach involves documenting:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the reasons behind a design decision,</li>
		<li>the justification for it,</li>
		<li>the other alternatives considered,</li>
		<li>the trade-offs evaluated, and</li>
		<li>the argumentation that led to the decision.</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote class="sms slug my-5">
		<p><b>TL;DR</b> — Design rationale is a formal method of &#8220;showing your work&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>As I see it there are three real problems with this methodology:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>(<em>In my experience</em>) A handful of notes discussed verbally is significantly more effective for communicating reasoning and sharing ideas;</li>
		<li>It&#8217;s incredibly time-intensive for designers to compose this type of documentation; and</li>
		<li><em>This brings me to what I appreciate most about Clark&#8217;s perspective:</em> Requiring designers to justify <strong>every</strong> decision squanders their most valuable asset — their intuition.</li>
	</ol>

	</figure>

	<p>Clark concludes his piece by suggesting that stakeholders shouldn&#8217;t expect justifications from designers, and this is the main point on which I disagree. From my perspective, each stakeholder represents a set of needs or pain-points, and it&#8217;s their job to ensure those concerns are addressed.</p>
	<p>The unique challenge in design is that <em>-unlike programming or accounting which need a special skill-set to even begin to understand-</em> design is accessible to everyone. As a result, &#8220;everyone&#8217;s a critic&#8221;; It&#8217;s like what Yelp did to restaurant reviews–you might have more perspectives to consider, but they&#8217;re not necessarily better-informed.</p>

	<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick diversion: Years ago I had <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/therealchrisbrown" target="_blank">a great boss</a> who regularly shared his wisdom. One gem that I've repeatedly come back to was his perspective on design seniority.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;The difference between junior and senior designers is not their ability to reason through a problem; it&#8217;s how many answers they already have in their back pocket.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>In our data-driven-everything world, it&#8217;s easy to forget that it takes groundbreaking work to do something revolutionary. When you look at an incredible product like the 1998 &#8216;bondi blue&#8217; iMac, it wasn&#8217;t incredible because it incrementally moved the needle, nor because it introduced some magical new technology; it was incredible because it was a new way of thinking about something we&#8217;d all taken for granted.</p>
	<p>In releasing the first iMac, Apple took a risk on a designer&#8217;s &#8220;educated guess&#8221; and in doing so, they changed an industry.</p>

	<figure class="full-width">

	<p>The first thing to know about engaging with design is that there are two kinds of feedback that stakeholders provide: <strong>Strategic</strong> feedback and <strong>Opinion-based</strong> feedback.</p>
	<p><strong>Strategic</strong> feedback is grounded in data, market research, functional requirements, and technical limitations; it guides a product by defining the framework for measuring success.</p>
	<p><strong>Opinion-based</strong> feedback is just that — an opinion. The best brands and products account for diverse perspectives, but <em>-not unlike a Jenga tower-</em> some pieces you can shift or rearrange, whereas others may cause the whole thing to come crashing down.</p>

		<!-- <figcaption>

	</figure>

	<p>The key to providing useful feedback is in providing the right kind of feedback at the right time. When starting a new project or major-version, challenging rationale with <strong>strategic</strong> feedback (aka &#8220;poking holes in a design&#8221;) almost always leads to a better, simpler product. By the end of the &#8216;design phase&#8217;, that same feedback can result in months or even years of wasted effort.</p>
	<p>By approaching Design with &#8216;goals&#8217; instead of &#8216;instructions&#8217;, designers are empowered to find the opportunities for improvement while preserving the integrity of the system.</p>
	<p>In the end, it takes time and patience to understand design&#8217;s role and the ways that design methodologies deliver results. There&#8217;s no better way to start that journey than by listening to designers and giving their intuition the chance to be right.</p>
