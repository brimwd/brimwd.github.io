	<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> supported the <strong>Amazon Prime: Campus</strong> team with UI design-work for their new "Shopping Profile" feature.</p>
	<p>The Shopping Profile is collects personal information about Amazon customers to support Amazon business initiatives and future projects.</p>
	<p>By providing Amazon with details about yourself including your age, gender, and more, Amazon can show you more-relevant products when you shop for things like clothing and other items.</p>

	<p>With a small banner on the home screen, our team could target specific interest-groups with relevant content (like a search for 'ugly sweaters' during the holidays) before rolling the feature out to the whole site.</p>

	<h2>High-Level Research Summary</h2>

	<p>Although the initial focus for the shopping profile was collecting age and gender, the intention is to scale the feature to eventually include clothing sizes; preferred clothing-fit; preferred brands; allergy, diet, and affiliation information; a general 'taste' profile.</p>

	<p>Extensive research was conducted with Amazon Customers between the ages of 18 and 35 to understand which aspects were most interesting, and what reservations -if any- they might have about using this type of feature.</p>

	<p>The most common feedback provided was a general concern that they might "miss" something they're interested in if Amazon filters the search.</p>

	<p>To address this concern, Amazon needs to earn their customers' trust by showing that the filtered results are better. My team's decision was to inject a widget at the top of the search results to show the filtered list rather than filtering everything automatically.</p>
