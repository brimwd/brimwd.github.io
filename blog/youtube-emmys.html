	<h1>Should YouTube Videos Be Eligible for Emmys? I have some thoughts...</h1>
	<!-- <h2>A mostly-complete, arguably-accurate, (and totally not-boring) illustrated guide to modern computer processors</h2> -->

	<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>bout a week ago I encountered the YouTube CEO's guest-column for the Hollywood Reporter declaring <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/youtube-ceo-emmys-creators-1235893700/" target="_blank">It's time for the Emmys to Embrace Creators"</a>, and I've been thinking about it ever since. "Is it time?" Why is it time?</p>
	<p>After a week of contemplation and research into the Emmys categories & awards; nomination & voting process; and the various organizations involved... I have some thoughts. </p>

	<hr>

  <p>The Emmys undoubtedly could add another category for user-generated content (and maybe they will one day), but I&#8217;m not convinced that the current structure of the awards really fits in this case.</p>
  <p>First, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards" target="_blank">the Emmys</a> primarily focus on content made and distributed in the USA, and that&#8217;s split into National or Regional awards depending on whether they reach more or less than half of Americans.</p>
  <p>YouTube is available to almost everyone with internet access, so presumably creators would have to compete in the American &#8220;National&#8221; or the &#8220;International&#8221; awards.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Sports, News & Documentary</strong>, and <strong>Children&#8217;s & Family</strong> categories could potentially nominate YouTube creators; I don&#8217;t know enough about how those categories are defined to say.</p>
  <p>That said, <a href="https://screenrant.com/tv-shows-that-started-on-youtube/" target="_blank">there are several shows</a> that started life on YouTube including Adventure Time, which was picked up by Cartoon Network and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Time" target="_blank">went on to win 8 Emmys</a>...</p>
  <p>In a way, you could say that &#8220;YouTube shows are already eligible once they reach a threshold of notoriety&#8221;. Kind of fits with the existing requirements around &#8220;reach&#8221; for National programming.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Presumably, to address the American focus, YouTube creators would need to be based in the USA to qualify for most awards. Given the substantially higher bar to be aired during &#8220;prime time&#8221;, non-sports/kids/news content would probably need to compete in the &#8220;daytime&#8221; category. I could be wrong, though; Apple TV&#8217;s (streaming-only) Ted Lasso won Primetime&#8217;s &#8220;Outstanding Comedy Series&#8221; in <a href="https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2021" target="_blank">2021 and <a href="https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2022" target="_blank">2022.</p>
  <p>In any case, relatively few awards are given each year: one for each of Outstanding Comedy and Drama series, and the rest are acting, writing, production-design, etc.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>One of the examples cited in the article, a YouTube series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGjBhEbq3-8xNkOTHp43W6gXEstJz7UhN" target="_blank"></a>&#8220;Challenge Accepted&#8221;, probably doesn&#8217;t qualify for any of the awards since it doesn&#8217;t seem to be heavily scripted, or &#8220;produced&#8221; in the traditional sense, and it&#8217;s mainly filmed &#8220;on location&#8221; while Michelle does ~something~.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>No scripts means it wasn&#8217;t really &#8220;acted&#8221; so much as it was &#8220;recorded&#8221;. Maybe it would qualify for an &#8220;unstructured Reality TV&#8221; award? But in that case, Michelle&#8217;s up against the likes of <a href="https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2021/outstanding-unstructured-reality-program" target="_blank">RuPaul&#8217;s Drag Race.</a></p>

  <hr>

  <p>&#8220;Challenge Accepted&#8221; was one of the few other examples cited in the article: specifically that the show has garnered &#8220;<em><b>640 million views</b></em>&#8221;... but that seems to be inaccurate.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Challenge Accepted&#8221; has 22 episodes, and after adding up the view counts listed for each episode, I came to a total of ~144.3 million views (±2-3 million). That&#8217;s nothing to scoff at, but it&#8217;s not &#8220;640 million&#8221; either.</p>
  <p>That number of &#8220;views&#8221; also doesn&#8217;t take into account that the total has been accumulated over the course of 6 years, nor can we differentiate between people who watched most of an episode vs those who clicked away after a few seconds.</p>
  <p>Michelle is doing something great and she&#8217;s really got an audience... but I think there&#8217;s a case to be made that she&#8217;s already receiving a hefty reward from YouTube in terms of ad-revenue... not to mention the literal award(s) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/creators/how-things-work/get-involved/awards/" target="_blank">she&#8217;s received from YouTube for clearing 100k and 1 million subscribers.</a></p>
  <p>Also cited, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GoodMythicalMorning" target="_blank">&#8220;Good Mythical Morning&#8221;</a>, has 18.7 million subscribers (awesome!) but their videos typically garner less than 1 million views.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd" target="_blank">MKBHD</a>, by contrast, has 18.9 million subscribers, but regularly clears 5 million views per video.</p>
  <p>That could be a difference of content volume (GMM&#8217;s 21 episodes this month vs MKBHD&#8217;s 5), but again, who knows about actual watch-durations.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>All of this is to say that creators on YouTube are doing great things, and they&#8217;ve already found ways of migrating to larger platforms (as with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.netflix.com/title/81002370&ved=2ahUKEwie__rM6pyGAxWujK8BHS-4D7QQFnoECHMQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2VtSnzakE9LTxh-BF4tDNC" target="_blank">Cobra Kai</a>, <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/broad-city-25fd484f-f2e1-43ff-a671-afd13d095690" target="_blank">Broad City</a>, Adam Ruins Everything, and Adventure Time) and receiving Emmys where the industry has seen merit.</p>
  <p>YouTube creators are also doing great in their own right, with many of the most-successful creators becoming millionaires from ad-revenue and sponsorships.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It&#8217;s fantastic that YouTube has created a system where anyone can create and the market can dictate how the content is funded. That&#8217;s true content-democracy.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What I don&#8217;t see is a reason for the Emmy Awards to change their focus away from recognizing and rewarding broadcast television. The gauntlet of bureaucracy, producers, and red-tape is enough to destroy most content, and the recognition is as much a reward for the creators as it is a <strong>reward for the studios and stations that had the guts to produce and broadcast it</strong>.</p>
  <p>It&#8217;s thanks to YouTube&#8217;s lack red-tape that our wild, creative, and often not-so-advertiser-friendly content can still get out into the world and thrive.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Rather than trying to force their way in, it would be great to see YouTube double-down on their own efforts to reward and recognize great content and creators on YouTube.</p>
  <p>If YouTube really wants to be included in a broadcast awards ceremony, why not start their own? YouTube could partner with Vimeo, TikTok, Nebula, and other services.</p>
  <p>Heck, they could even partner with Disney+, Netflix, Apple TV+, and the big studios too, and host a streaming-focused awards show.</p>
  <p>To create market differentiation and give YouTube an edge, there could be rules stipulating conditions like <em>&#8220;content has to be available online to stream&#8221;</em>. They could really shake things up by allowing content from any year (fits better with the streaming model), but could require that the content is newly available to stream &#8220;this year&#8221; if it wasn&#8217;t already available.</p>
  <p>The YouTube sponsored Streaming Awards could even include extra award categories for content that&#8217;s available to stream for free <em>&#8220;to promote democratizing access&#8221;</em> (the YouTube way).</p>
  <p>YouTube also has a great opportunity to start a &#8220;Path to Broadcast&#8221; program for Creators to get discovered by broadcasters. YouTube could form official partnerships with &#8220;premium&#8221; services to share licensing, collaborate on marketing, or just to build connections that will help the Creators on their journey.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>YouTube could even stay involved in the negotiations to ensure that the content still streams on YouTube and that the creators don&#8217;t lose the rights to their stories or characters.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>YouTube could become not-only the best place to publish content, but the best champions for our content.<br />That&#8217;s the YouTube I want to watch.</p>
  <p>Honestly, who even needs the Emmys?</p>
