	<h2>A Serially Missed Opportunity</h2>
	<!-- <p><time datetime="2021-01-31">January 31, 2021</time> • 8 min read</p> -->

	<h3>The Issue <small>(<em>pun intended</em>)</small></h3>
	<p>Amazon, Apple's iTunes and iBooks treat 'bundles' and installments of series as discrete units without the context of the greater 'whole' that is <strong>the series</strong>.</p>
	<p>Each issue, episode, book, volume, season, or collection behaves as a distinct unit united to the others only through sharing a title and generally some minimal meta-data. As a result, while it's relatively easy to see all works by a particular author, or to query for all books published in August of 2016, to sort on any one piece of meta-data for a series is likely to come up short (or long).</p>

	<h3>Object-Permanence</h3>
	<p>It would be crazy to treat me as four separate individuals when you consider me as a member of my family, as an individual, as a member of my team at work, and as an American citizen. If I can speak Spanish at work, it would be silly to think that I'd suddenly lost that skill as soon as a left the office; I either can or I can't, because although my surroundings or context may have changed, what makes me 'me' has not.</p>

	<h3>What's in a name?</h3>
	<p>I felt inspired to write this article upon re-watching the series 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' (TNG, for short) on my Apple TV. TNG debuted in 1987 and ran for 7 seasons until the series finally concluded in 1994. On a cursory inspection, it seems like querying for TNG should be relatively straightforward; The title never changed, and the cast was fairly consistent throughout the show's production. On the surface, it seems like presenting TNG as a cohesive series should be as easy as pulling a carton of eggs from your fridge - they're all "the same" and packaged under the discrete unit of "Star Trek: The Next Generation"... aren't they?</p>

	<h3>Let's break it down</h3>
	<p>In addition to the 7 television seasons, there were also 4 feature-length films starring the cast and characters. The movies were produced after the TV series had officially ended, but were meant to continue <em>that</em> narrative. This leads us to the existential question at hand, "Do those films count as part of the TNG 'series' or are they something else?"</p>
	<p>I'm sure <dl><dt>Trekkies</dt><dd>Star Trek fans</dd></dl> could argue all day about whether the franchise's films count as cannonical content or not, but for distributors there is a very real, very lucrative reason for unequivocally answering that question "Yes".</p>

	<h3>Store-Tech: The Next Generation</h3>
	<p>Selling a 'series' is different from selling a "bundle" of content, because it requires understanding the fundamental difference is between content and that content's cognitive-grouping. This might matter to users because it makes it easier to binge a complete series or access related content, but it <em>should</em> matter to distributors because if you can show me the relevant movies in a TV series as I'm watching it, there's a good chance I'll buy or rent the content I don't own so I can "watch the whole thing".</p>
	<p>This is especially important with content that tends to get repackaged several times. A comic series I follow called Saga is currently released as individual comic "issues" (about 20 pages long), then later is re-released as "volumes" (containing about 8 comics of content or ~170 pages), and finally as "books" (containing 3 volumes of content - more than 500 pages).</p>
	<p>If I have bought <u>Book 1</u>, what would you guess the odds are that I will buy <u>Volume 1</u> or <u>Issue 7</u>, for that matter? Do you think the chances are better that I'll buy <u>Issue 7</u> (contained in <u>Book 1</u>, which I already own) or <u>Volume 4</u> (the next mid-size collection of comics starting where <u>Book 1</u> leaves off)? What about <u>Book 2</u> will I wait for Volumes 4, 5, and 6 to be consolidated into a hard-cover 'Book'?</p>
	<p>I don't have any evidence to support my theory in this case except for my anecdotal experiences, but the people I have known who tend toward collecting things (or buying complete series) like to own things in the same format. I've known many Harry Potter fans to re-purchase Harry Potter Book 1 so that they can have a hardcover copy to match their hardcover copies of the rest of the series. In my own case, although I'm eager to read the next installment of Saga, I already own Books 1 and 2 so I'm willing to wait another few months for Book 3 to be released.</p>

	<h3>So what else is new?</h3>
	<p>While "organic" content discovery is great and happens "organically" without any input or nudging from distributors, there's no reason that you can't or shouldn't <em>nudge</em> me to let me know when something new comes out. As of this moment, I've purchased 11 seasons of <u>Adventure Time</u> and <u>The X-Files</u>; 9 seasons of <u>Archer</u>, <u>Futurama</u>, and <u>Bob's Burgers</u>; 7 seasons of <u>Steven Universe</u>, <u>Game of Thrones</u>, <u>Star Trek: The Next Generation</u>, and <u>The Venture Bros.</u> on iTunes. That's a <em>lot</em> of money on content; doesn't it seem reasonable if not outright <strong>obvious</strong> that I would buy another season of any one of those shows?</p>

	</figure>

	<h3>Seriously?</h3>
	<p>If there is <em>new</em> content, then "Yes, without a doubt" I will eventually buy it... I might even pre-order it!, but right now, in spite of the fact that I've purchased every single episode of <u>Adventure Time</u> through iTunes, as far as iTunes is concerned, I only own 12 of 20 seasons. "Why?", you ask? Because some of the episodes have been re-bundled as "collections".</p>

	<h3>Growing pains</h3>
	<p>Remodeling data is not fun, converting data is less fun, and I can only imagine what a grueling, anxiety-inducing chore it would be to try to remodel the data on a set as large as iTunes' video library, but old wisdom says "A stitch in time saves nine"; when you see a problem, it pays to be proactive.</p>
	<p>In a nutshell, I've purchased every single season of the TV show, The Venture Bros. on iTunes. and my trillion-dollar question (or my $30-question, depending on how you look at it) is "Why did I have to accidentally discover that (after a 2.5 year recess) a new season is being produced?"</p>
	<p>Recognizing buying habits by fundamentally understanding the notion of a 'series' (abstracted from how its bundled) and prominently promoting "next installment" content will change the way the world buys media.</p>

	<h2>How Recommendations Engines Fail Customers<span>(and some ideas on how to fix them)</span></h2>

	<h3>What gives?</h3>
	<p id="better-ads-term-1">Advertising sucks… doesn't it? From the 'high-pressure salesman' to overly-loud commercials on YouTube<sup><a href="#better-ads-footnote-1">1</a></sup>, ads range from annoying to downright-uncomfortable and everybody in the modern world knows it -- what gives?</p>
	<p>While it's entirely too-common for ads to be annoying, I think it's more interesting to contemplate the occasions when they're not.</p>

	<figure class="fr">
		<img src="images/blog/better-ads-1.png" alt="A drawing of an 'evil' advertising team" />

	</figure>

	<p>For starters, I don't think advertising is inherently is bad or some sort of 'burden' that we as consumers must bear. That said, the real question in my mind becomes "How do the good intentions of so many smart, talented marketing people result in this near-universal feeling of discomfort consumers experience in response to advertising?"</p>

	<h3>We're born and then we die, and in the middle, we buy</h3>
	<p>To get to the heart of it, I think we need to take a step back and examine the steps in a product's life cycle:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A company identifies demand for a solution to some "problem"</li>
		<li>The company designs and develops products to solve that problem</li>
		<li>The company works to drive consumer awareness of those products</li>
		<li>And finally, product-aware consumers work to acquire those products and solve their problems</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Your position in the queue is 824,307 <i class="fa fa-question" aria-title="an screencapture of my position on the one-dot-one-dot-one-dot-one VPN waitlist"></i></h3>
	<p id="better-ads-term-2">Obviously, if a consumer can't get their hands on a product because of supply limitations or because they simply can't afford it, then the products will never reach full "market saturation" as defined by 100% of demand being satisfied. Although genuine supply limitations will naturally inflate the cost of some goods like private islands, in the case of most products, simply timing your announcements with your manufacturing cycle should head off most supply-related issues. Unprecedented demand, delays in manufacturing, or a misguided desire to create 'haves' and 'have-nots' can still create PR issues<sup><a href="#better-ads-footnote-2">2</a></sup>, but rapidly ramping-up manufacturing or rolling out lower-priced models often smooths out those wrinkes.</p>

	</figure>

	<p>"Extreme-luxury" and naturally supply-limited products aside, if we work backwards through the product life cycle, the next major hurdle for product adoption is driving consumer awareness.</p>

	<h3>Too many channels</h3>
	<p>On one level it seems obvious that consumers of a given product or brand - like fans of a TV show - should know when there's something new, but it's my observation that that's really only true when:</p>

	<ol id="better-ads-term-3">
		<li>Consumers get the product notifications directly from the manufacturer,</li>
		<li>Consumers purchase from or visit their purchase source<sup><a href="#better-ads-footnote-3">3</a></sup> frequently, or</li>
		<li>There are frequent product updates that consumers can subscribe to or learn to look for</li>
	</ol>

	<figure class="fr">

	</figure>

	<p>Even with wildly successful series like Harry Potter, if you don't frequent bookstores or hang out with devotees, odds are that you won't immediately know when a new book is available.</p>
	<p>When you go long-enough without thinking about a series you like, you can forget what happened in the last installment which may lead you to give up, forgoing purchasing the rest.</p>
	<p>For fans of a series, it's <em>sucks</em> to miss out. For a creators, publishers, and retailers, losing fans means losing a source of revenue.</p>
	<p>How can we turn this around in a way that's zero-effort for consumers? To answer that question we need to look no further than our local movie theater.</p>
	
	<h3>A trip to the movies</h3>
	<p>As a kid I remember some of my friends getting mad if we were late to a movie and missed the movie trailers that play before the feature. At first I thought it was just because they were worried about missing the first few minutes of the movie -- after all, as a serially-tardy individual, I lived in fear of this outcome too.</p>
	<p>After attending a few films with my best friend and his dad, though, I quickly realized that there's no better place to get excited about about other movies you can see. My biggest regret was that I often couldn't remember more than one or two of the trailers by the end of the film. Fast forward 20 years, I haven't gotten much better about keeping to a schedule, but I <em>still</em> go out of my way to show up early to movies so I can catch the trailers and get a head-start on my $8 popcorn.</p>
	<p>When I reflect on the disparity between my experience watching movie trailers and my experience urgently trying to skip ads on Youtube, I see a few differences.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>First, there's the context: I'm not trying to achieve a goal or complete a task at the movie theater; I'm there for entertainment and I've set aside dedicated time for it.</li>
		<li>Second, I've learned to expect that a majority of the trailers I see will appeal to me, rspecially because movie trailers generally seem to match the genre and target-demographic of the feature.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Movies are a unique environment becauase you have a captive audience who've paid a not-insignificant amount of money to be there. While other environments might be less of a "marketer's dream" in that you have a lower confidence about your audience, there's still abundant opportunity to partner with content creators and be strategic about ad placement.</p>
	<p id="better-ads-term-4">While the average person might struggle with acne, paying for acne-medication ads to play before Minecraft videos on Youtube (whose audience tends to be young teenagers and pre-teens<sup><a href="#better-ads-footnote-2">2</a></sup>) is probably not as good a use of advertising dollars as paying for ads to play before <u>makeup</u>, <u>beauty</u>, and <u>home remedy</u> videos (which have an audience that is specifically looking to address facial aesthetics).</p>l
