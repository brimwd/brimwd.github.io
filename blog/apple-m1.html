	<h1>Apple M1? What the heck is &#8216;ARM&#8217;?</h1>
	<h2>A mostly-complete, arguably-accurate, (and totally not-boring) illustrated guide to modern computer processors</h2>
	<!-- <p><time datetime="2020-11-29">Nov 29, 2020</time> ‚Ä¢ 6 min read</p> -->

	<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>irst off, computer processors (aka &#8220;CPUs&#8221; or &#8220;Central Processing Units&#8221; if you wanna talk like a character in Star Trek) have largely been the unsung heroes of computer advances. When it comes to year-over-year processor-improvements, you have two main aspects:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>&#8220;transistors&#8221; (the bits that do all the &#8216;thinking&#8217;) get smaller and more-numerous as the manufacturing technology gets better, and</li>
		<li>the various other pieces get shuffled around to distribute heat / energy better</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The hardware is basically the same from chip to chip ‚Äî it&#8217;s just a question of how big your <b>transistors</b> are, how many <b>transistors</b> you have, and how all of the other pieces are arranged. In short:</p>

	<blockquote class="sms slug">
		<p>More transistors = more brainpower</p>
		<p>Smaller transistors = faster thinking</p>
	</blockquote>

	<hr>

	<p>Many articles I&#8217;ve seen are quick to point out &#8220;This isn&#8217;t the first time Apple has changed <b>Architecture</b>&#8221;, but they don&#8217;t really explain what that means... If you&#8217;ll forgive the analogy, <b>Imagine changing your car from gasoline to diesel</b>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Both are &#8220;liquid fuels&#8221;, and both &#8220;combust&#8221; in the engine block, and the end result is the same ‚Äî through some magic, the wheels turn.</p>
		<p>Still, you can&#8217;t go to the regular gas pumps anymore and your &#8216;remaining distance&#8217; estimate (if you have a fancy car with a computer) doesn&#8217;t have a clue how far you can go.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Changing the <b>Architecture</b> in your processor is similar in many ways, because while there aren&#8217;t any explosions (hopefully), the software (&#8216;fuel&#8217;) runs with certain expectations about what the environment is like:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>A gasoline burns fast at low-pressure (and the engine uses spark plugs); diesel burn slowly at high pressure (without spark plugs).</p>
	</blockquote>

	<hr>

	<p>When Apple changed <b>Architecture</b> the last time around, they built a special program called &#8220;Rosetta&#8221; to help ease the transition. When a program asks for a certain feature that the new processors don&#8217;t have, <b>Rosetta</b> would intercept the request and would &#8220;fake&#8221; the answer.</p>
	<p>Back in the early-90s, Apple was using a CPU from Motorola called the &#8216;68000 series&#8217; <emoji>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</emoji>, but in 1994, the <b>PowerPC Architecture</b> (aka &#8216;PPC&#8217;) was introduced and Apple jumped ship.</p>

	</figure>

	<p>Eleven years later (in 2005), Apple realized that the limitations of the <b>PowerPC Architecture</b> weren&#8217;t worth the benefits and they made the hard choice to pivot their entire platform to use Intel&#8217;s &#8216;<b>x86</b>&#8217; <b>Architecture</b> instead. Now in the 2000s there were a lot more Mac users than there were in the &#8217;90s, so Apple created the <b>Rosetta</b> program to ease the transition for anyone buying a new Mac.</p>
	<p>Fast-forward fifteen years to today (in 2020), and...</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Apple realized that the limitations of the <b>Intel x86 Architecture</b> weren&#8217;t worth the benefits and they made the hard choice to pivot their entire platform to use <b>their own custom chip on the &#8216;ARM&#8217;  Architecture</b> instead.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Apple has been designing their own chips for years to use in iPhones, iPads, and watches, so I feel confident that their new <b>Apple &#8216;M1&#8217; ARM</b> chips will be real workhorses. They&#8217;ve also updated their <b>Rosetta</b> program (now &#8216;Rosetta 2&#8217;) to do exactly the same thing it did before, except this time it helps the <b>ARM</b> version of MacOS run applications for the old <b>Intel x86 Architecture</b>.</p>

	<hr>

	<p>Now you know what they&#8217;re doing, but why make the switch? And how can Apple&#8217;s M1 chips be 3x faster than comparable "Intel-type" (<b>x86</b>) chips? If you can forgive another analogy: <b>A processor&#8217;s architecture is a lot like a house</b>...</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Imagine you have a ranch-style one-floor house with a big yard. You can add a pool, you can add a garage and a guest suite, you can build a rooftop deck, and if you&#8217;re really careful, you might be able to add a second floor or even a 3rd floor. Try adding a basement, though, and the whole house falls apart. Same, if you want to convert your yard to a launchpad for rocket ships, the city is going to come shut you down because you&#8217;re not zoned for that.</p>
	</blockquote>

	</figure>

	<p>There&#8217;s a certain point where an <b>Architecture</b> has hit its limits.. you might even remember back in ~2009 when everybody was trying to get &#8220;<em>4GB of RAM</em>&#8221; (computer memory), but &#8220;<em>Windows only supports 3GB</em>&#8221;... that wasn&#8217;t actually Microsoft or Windows&#8217; fault. That was actually the limits of the <b>x86 Architecture</b>. When <b>x86</b> was introduced in 1978, &#8220;4GB of RAM&#82121; was inconceivable, and when <b>x86</b> was later-updated (in 1985), it was still inconceivable.</p>

	<figure class="float-left">
		<img src="images/blog/apple-m1/planning-x86.png" class="invert" title="A cartoon of chip-designers in the 1970s discussing the need for 'at least 128KB of memory' in the next design." />
		<figcaption>
			<p>I wasn&#8217;t around for the conversation, but I imagine it went something like this...</p>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>For decades, all of our computers were running on <em><b>the best-laid plans of engineers in the 70s...</b></em></p>
	<p>In 2003 the <b>x86 Architecture</b> was updated from the &#8220;<b>32-bit</b>&#8221; computing of the 1980s to a more powerful &#8220;<b>64-bit</b>&#8221; way of doing things.</p>
	<p>On the surface, it just looked like an update &#8220;to allow for more than 3GB of RAM&#8221;, although technically it does a lot more than that. (More about memory in the footnote)</p>
	<p>Finally, let&#8217;s return to our analogy about upgrading your house...</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Once you&#8217;ve maximized every square inch of your plot, there&#8217;s nothing else you can add without taking something out, and your house is such a hulking behemoth that it takes an hour to find the bathroom.</p>
	</blockquote>

		<img src="images/blog/apple-m1/permit-denied.png" class="invert" title="A sketch of the same house with a second floor added and a pool. An outline of a rocket in the backyard says 'PERMIT DENIED'" />
	</figure>

	<p>When you reach that point in your <b>Architecture</b> fantasy where you can&#8217;t go any further, you can <em>cling desperately to what you have because it&#8217;s &#8220;home&#8221;</em> <strong>or</strong> you can <em>take the best things that you learned</em> from <b>x86</b> and move to <b>ARM</b> to start fresh - this time with plans for a basement AND a rocket-ship.</p>
	<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I think Apple&#8217;s transition to <b>ARM</b> will go just fine... <em>and I can&#8217;t wait for Microsoft to work up the courage to make the switch, too.</em></p>

	<hr>

	<p><b class="big">Footnote about how memory works</b></p>
	<p>If you&#8217;re wondering &#8220;why was there ever a &#8216;memory-limit&#8217; on Windows in the first place?&#8221;, it&#8217;s because (one more analogy!) &#8220;RAM&#8221; memory is a little like a phone book...</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Imagine your phone placed a call as soon as you dialed a single digit; there&#8217;d only be enough numbers for 10 people. (0, 1, 2, and so on until you reach the highest number, 9)</p>
		<p>If you have 2 digits available, then you can call up to 100 people. (00, 01, etc until you reach 99)</p>
		<p>If you have 3 digits, you can call 1000 people... you see where I&#8217;m going.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The <b>32-bit</b> processor <b>Architectures</b> of the &#8217;80s could &#8220;dial&#8221; 2<sup>32</sup> numbers and get the memory stored there (which ends up being about 3.2 gigabytes at the high-end). By increasing the computing capacity with <b>64-bit Architectures</b>, processors can now &#8220;dial&#8221; 2<sup>64</sup> numbers to access a whopping <strong>16.8 exabytes</strong> of memory. <em>That&#8217;s 16.8 billion gigabytes!</em></p>
	<p><em>Suffice it to say that we probably won&#8217;t have to increase our computing bits for the sake of &#8220;maximum addressable memory&#8221; anytime soon.</em></p>
	<p>When Windows and (<em>with more pomp and circumstance</em>) MacOS were updated to operate on the 64-bit version of <b>x86</b>, that was also an <b>Architecture</b> change, but because the 64-bit version of <b>x86</b> was built with the same core design as the 32-bit version, the <b>Architecture</b> was automatically backwards-compatible for old <b>x86</b> software.</p>
	<p>That meant that old programs could still run (<em>including, unfortunately, old viruses and malware</em>), but it also meant that we were stuck with old mistakes and issues from the 32-bit version of the <b>x86 Architecture</b>, too.</p>
