<h1>Horrible UX: iPhone Apps on iPad (& 4 Ways Apple Could Improve)</h1>

<p>In the decade since Steve walked on stage in San Francisco and unveiled the iPad, there’s one piece of (horrible) UX that’s stood the test of time. I'm speaking, of course, of running "made for iPhone" apps that don't have iPad companions.</p>

<p>Let's start from the beginning... Before the Retina Display "made everything blocky" or the iPhone 4’s "AntennaGate" prompted Apple to give out free silicon bumpers, we had the early App Store. At the time, all of the mere 100,000 apps in the were made for tiny little original-iPhone screens. The iPad, with it’s larger and more-square screen, simply couldn’t render the iPhone apps full-screen without stretching or cropping them.</p>

<p>While Apple waited for the developer community to build apps tailored for the iPad, they decided to band-aid the problem of "there are no apps for iPad" by simply centering the iPhone apps in the middle of the iPad screen. It's not the most elegant fix, but it worked and Apple had faith that the developers would come through.</p>
<p>With your iPhone app sitting awkwardly in the middle of your screen, you have two options: By default the apps will render at "1X" (the original resolution as you would see on an iPhone) or by tapping a little button in the bottom right corner you could switch to "2X" (technically ‘4x’ because the app would run at twice the width and twice the height, and mostly fill the screen).</p>

<p>The weird thing is, even when you hit (2X) to scale the app up, it still doesn't fill the screen like you would expect. Instead of stretching to 100% in one direction and letterboxing the other (like every screen you've used this century will do automatically with content for a different aspect ratio), Apple opted to letterbox all four sides in a move that is sure to induce mild panic and dry heaving in designers the world over.</p>

<p>To Apple's credit, this probably made a lot of sense back in 2010, because 2x was as big as you could scale an app and still come out with an even number of pixels.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2020 and if you’re anything like me, upon encountering this awful band-aid for the first time in 2020, you’d be totally justified in asking "What was Apple thinking?"</p>

<p>Now most apps I use on my iPad these days are built specifically for iPad and I don’t even think about it, but once in a while I’ll encounter a banking app or I’ll decide to check on my investments and suddenly I’m hurled back in time to appreciate a UX problem Apple never bothered to fix… not even with the 2019 release of iPad OS, ‘the OS made just for iPad’.</p>

<p>Let's take a peek at Robinhood, the Millennial-friendly, no-fees stock-trading app to see how my optimistic I should feel about retirement.</p>

<blockquote>Oh my god, everything's gone sideways! At least they gave me this little ‘2X’ button so I can double my money.</blockquote>

<p><em>Nope, that didn't help either.</em></p>

<p>Given Apple’s reputation for "magical" UX, you'd be forgiven for assuming that I’m the idiot here and I simply screwed up my images somehow or I've locked my screen orientation and forgotten about it, but I really haven't.</p>

<p>Despite all of the technological progress and the fact that even the iPad Mini with its diminutive resolution of 2048-by-1536 (at 326 ppi) still has more than enough realestate** to render iPhone apps "sideways" so they can appear upright while using your iPad in landscape (as you would with a keyboard).</p>

<p>When Steve stood on that stage and announced the iPad it seemed like the world was convinced that developers would practically claw their eyes out at the opportunity to (re)build all of their apps for iPad. That, however, did't turn out to be the case. Whether it was the lack of financial incentive (because Apple promised consumers that developers would do the work for free), or because the iPad's underwhelming sales figures** left developers focused on greener pastures... I'll never know.</p>

<p>What I do know is that it's high time the <s>iOS</s> iPad OS team address this UX blunder so that it can become a footnote in the history of <em>the legendary success of another Apple product</em>.</p>

<p>Here's some inspirational crap for any designers who might be looking for a lesson in all of this: My advice to you is to <strong>take notes as you do your work</strong>, be honest about your design's problem-areas, and revisit the ugly solutions from time to time.</p>

<p>Products, markets, people, and minds change; Old technical constraints shouldn't limit your future. If you're open about the compromises you made, you'll be better equipped to remedy them when the opportunities arise.</p>
<blockquote>Don't let band-aids become "the way we've always done things".</blockquote>

<p>For anyone at Apple who might come across this, I've produced 4 potential solutions that it's (probably) not too late to release as part of the next iPad OS.</p>

**The iPad Mini has the smallest resolution of any iPad currently available on Apple.com. With a landscape resolution of 2048-by-1536 resolution at 326 ppi, an iPhone 8 app (with the older 16x9 aspect ratio and a portrait resolution of 750-by-1334 at 326 ppi) would float comfortably on the right third of the screen with a 100 pixel buffer above and below.
By contrast, scaling the app to "2x" as iOS currently does (assuming the iPad is in portrait mode) would require the iPad to be almost 30% taller to accomodate the 2668px necessary to render without any distortion from a fractional multiplier.

***iPad sales were nothing to scoff at, but when compared to iPhones, which had sold over 10x as many units by the end of the iPad's first year, it's hard to imagine developers optimizing apps for the comparatively less-lucrative market.
