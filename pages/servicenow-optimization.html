<section class="overview">
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>From eliminating dead-ends to improving the way we communicate, I have a lot of ideas about how to improve ServiceNow's website.</p>
	<p>With access to the analytics dashboard and a few supportive colleagues who vetted my work, I was able to share new insights into our visitors' experience in a presentation that ultimately led to the formation of a new pillar reporting up to the VP of Digital Marketing.</p>
	<p>As of today, January 25, 2021, this journey is still underway; however, now that we have an optimization team and a purpose, work is quickly progressing on our first series of tests to challenge my hypotheses.</p>
	<blockquote class="disclaimer">

	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>For as long as I've been with ServiceNow, the web-marketing UX team has been responsible for all design, strategy, and content (with approval and review from the brand team) that gets published on the "core" website.</p>
	<p>While UX has "delivered results" in that visitor-engagement would change as designs evolved, scrutinizing the analyses and metrics provided as evidence of success led me to wonder if we were really accomplishing anything.</p>
	<p>Often KPIs like "engagement" would be shared, but only at an individual page or component level without ever exploring the full user journey or broader outcomes. Justifications were often provided like "well it's hard to get real numbers beyond this scope" or "we know that 8% of traffic to form pages converts, so we can assume that driving more traffic to forms results in commensurate outcomes."</p>
	<p>For me, refusing to do something because it's difficult or because we are self-assured in our outcomes feels disingenuous and lacking in rigor.</p>
	<p>Hearing this kind of justification, I developed a reputation in my organization for scrutinizing outcomes and challenging rationale. It was this reputation that finally made the difference for our organization, as a manager of the analytics team finally reached out to me to say "I agree with your assessment, so here's an analytics dashboard; time to put your money where your mouth is."</p>

	<h2>Discovery</h2>
	<img src="../images/servicenow/fake-analytics.svg" class="can-zoom" alt="This is fake analytics data" />
	<p>Given our historically-shallow analyses of outcomes, it should come as no surprise that gating of content is rampant throughout the site and -as a result- form pages rank among our highest-trafficked.</p>
	<p>Access to our Analytics Data was all I needed to confirm my suspicions; we did not have a steady "8%" conversion rate (reminder: this is a made-up number), but actually something closer to one-tenth the oft-cited figure.</p>
	<p>This data tells a damning story, showing irrefutably how embracing a strategy of "funnel traffic to forms as quickly as possible", deprived our visitors of the opportunity to "get sold on the idea" of ServiceNow before they hit what essentially amounted to a pay-wall.</p>
	<p>Having clear evidence of the outcomes I suspected still left me with the challenge of proving that we were causing the problem (and are also capable of turning it around).</p>
	<p>Now, I understand why it might be tempting to focus all of our effort on the form pages -- they certainly have the highest traffic, and clearly there are some "secrets" to be learned between the highest and lowest performing.</p>
	<p>The trouble with that conclusion, is that this data is artificial (figuratively AND literally in this case) –– people aren't visiting the forms because they want to; they're visiting the forms because we're tricking them or forcing them. That inflates traffic numbers (and user frustration)... it's no wonder the bounce rates are sky high.</p>

	<h2>Research</h2>
	<img src="../images/servicenow/fake-traffic.jpg" class="can-zoom" alt="This is fake traffic data" />
	<p>Using my intuition about this situation (as well as basic economics theory and my own frustrating-experiences with our website), I concluded that visitors are not filling the forms because we haven't convinced them that there's enough value on the other side to be worth the effort. (Have I mentioned that the form has ~13 fields?)</p>
	<p>Looking to the "lower trafficked pages" (ie, all of our content pages), I made an alarming discovery: a majority of the traffic visiting content pages immediately Exits, gets lost, or bounces to a new page before immediately returning.</p>
	<p>You might think that "bounce" is visitors hitting a form (and some of it is), but much more of it is visitors returning to the home page or landing on a page from the same product suite before returning to the product they just looked at.</p>
	<p>Between users scattering throughout the site or Exiting completely, within a few touch-points we bleed almost 100% of our traffic... that's traffic we're spending boatloads of money to acquire.</p>

	<p>Given our strong sales figures and historical user-research data, I recommended that we explore whether visitors even understand what ServiceNow does at a basic level. As a tangential challenge, I've also made recommendations to try to tackle the more-existential issue of our anemic return-visitor metrics.</p>
	<p>Step 1: Convince the organization that this issue matters enough to prioritize and address immediately.</p>
