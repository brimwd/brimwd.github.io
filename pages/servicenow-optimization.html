	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>From eliminating dead-ends to improving the way we communicate, I have a lot of ideas about how to improve ServiceNow's website.</p>
	<p>With access to the analytics dashboard and a few supportive colleagues who vetted my work, I was able to share new insights into our visitors' experience in a presentation that ultimately led to the formation of a new pillar reporting up to the VP of Digital Marketing.</p>
	<p>As of today, January 25, 2021, this journey is still underway; however, now that we have an optimization team and a purpose, work is quickly progressing on our first series of tests to challenge my hypotheses.</p>
	<blockquote class="disclaimer">

	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>In the "Digital" (web-marketing) organization at ServiceNow the UX Design team is responsible for all design, strategy, and content (with approval and review from the brand team) that gets published on the "core" website.</p>
	<p>While UX has "delivered results" to the extent that we can see engagement metrics changing over time, scrutinizing the analyses and metrics provided as "evidence of success" led me to wonder if we were really accomplishing what we set out to.</p>
	<p>Performance indicators like "engagement" can be a valuable tool in assessing the results of an A/B test, but it's hard to say what the impact might be on the full user journey or broader outcomes without more in-depth analyses.</p>
	<p>A big part of my job and how I bring value to my team is in scrutinizing our approaches and identifying ways we can improve -- in this case with testing rigor and deeper analysis of outcomes.</p>
	<p>Last year, I changed departments so that I could move into a more influential role in the Marketing Organization. On my new team I've become friends with our Analytics Manager, and he recently granted me access to our Site Traffic Dashboard.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Discovery</h2>
	<div class="gallery"><img src="../images/servicenow/fake-analytics.svg" class="invert" alt="This is fake analytics data" /><img src="../images/servicenow/fake-conversion.jpg" class="invert" alt="This is fake form-conversion data" /><img src="../images/servicenow/the-form.png" class="invert" alt="The standard form" /><span>(click to expand)</span><span class="collapse"><i class="fa fa-times"></i> collapse</span></div>
	<p>Early in my time at ServiceNow, I conducted a series of interviews and usability tests to explore opportunities to improve form conversion. In my research, participants were consistently caught off-guard, upset, frustrated when they requested a demo and hit a form page instead.</p>
	<p>Through my research I understood a pain-point, but it wasn't until I got a look at our traffic flow and engagement metrics that I really understood the problem.</p>
	<p>Historically we've embraced a strategy of "funnel traffic to forms as quickly as possible" under the misguided notion that a flat "8%" (Reminder: this is a made-up number) of traffic converted.</p>
	<p>Given our colossal bounce and exit-rates, however, I can see how our strategy has backfired and instead has deprived our visitors of the opportunity to "get sold ServiceNow" before they hit what essentially amounts to a pay-wall.</p>
	<p>Having clear evidence of the outcomes I suspected still left me with the challenge of proving that we were causing the problem (and capable of turning it around).</p>
	<p>It's easy to understand why my colleagues are focused on the form pages â€“ they have the highest traffic and the most measurable outcomes; The trouble with this strategy, however, is that this data is artificial (figuratively AND literally in this case).</p>
	<p>In a nutshell, people aren't visiting the forms because they <em>want</em> to; they're visiting the forms because we're tricking them or forcing them to. The way it inflates traffic numbers (and user frustration)... it's no wonder the bounce rates are sky high.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Research</h2>
	<img src="../images/servicenow/fake-traffic.jpg" class="can-zoom invert" alt="This is fake traffic data" />
	<p>It's my hypothesis that visitors are not filling the forms because we haven't convinced them that there's enough value on the other side to be worth the effort.</p>
	<p>In my previous research, participants verbally communicated a fear that some high-pressure salesperson was going to call and harass them (or that they'd be stuck on an email list forever) if they filled out the form.</p>
	<p>I can't change the form without causing a significant disruption to the sales pipeline, but looking to the "lower trafficked pages" (ie, all of our content pages) there's still enormous opportunity to "sell our visitors on ServiceNow" before we hit them in the face with a form.</p>
	<p>Digging deeper into the user flow, I also made an alarming discovery: Between users scattering throughout the site or exiting completely, within a few touch-points we bleed almost 100% of our traffic... and a lot of that traffic we're spending boatloads of money to acquire.</p>
	<p>The real challenge at this stage was finding the right samples and generating appropriate comparisons and charts to demonstrate the issues and convince the leadership team without overwhelming them with details and data. Finally after 6 weeks of analysis, preparation, and guerilla research, I was ready to present my findings to the organization.</p>

	<h2>Planning</h2>
	<p>Given our strong sales figures and historical user-research data, I recommended that we explore whether visitors even understand what ServiceNow does at a basic level. As a tangential challenge, I've also made recommendations to try to tackle the more-existential issue of our anemic return-visitor metrics.</p>
	<p>Step 1: Convince the organization that this issue matters enough to prioritize and address immediately.</p>
