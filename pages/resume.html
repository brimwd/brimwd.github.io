<h2>Summary</h2>
<section id="summary">
	<p>I'm a product design manager; I empower teams to automate the world with smart, user-centric workflows and strategic, human-powered support.</p>
	<p>The product-development life-cycle is complex and multifaceted. Using experience as a cross-functional designer, engineer, researcher, and marketer, I facilitate communication across teams to improve understanding, trust, and collaboration.</p>
	<p>As a mentor and startup-founder, I keep my skills sharp and practice communication daily. Great teams are built with respect, open-communication, and a passion for your product. Together we solve meaningful problems for real people.</p>

	<aside>
		<p>I founded ScheduleUX to solve a simple problem: Streamline scheduling for moderated, in-person, user research.</p>
		<p>With ScheduleUX, a researcher can create a research proposal in a few minutes (less than two if their study description is already written) and participants can sign up, reschedule, and cancel in a way that is entirely self-service.</p>
		<p>As a researcher using ScheduleUX, the only things I need to worry about are preparing my study and showing up to my sessions.</p>
