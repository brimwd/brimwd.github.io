	<h1>Product Management Dictionary</h1>
	<p>A community-sourced reference for software terms</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>The Product Management Dictionary is a <a href="x-dictionary:r:">MacOS Dictionary</a> extension I built with one of the people I mentor in product-design.</p>
	<p>The goals of this project were to teach my mentee about the iterative design process; to help her learn see how &#8220;solutions can always be improved&#8221;; and to practice discussing requirements, enhancements, pain-points, and problem statements.</p>

	<h2>Project Origin</h2>
	<p>As part of her independent studying and research efforts, my mentee found a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O4N2pu6Mu-UBhUR3pdbv6dcjNecu7oMdIX1jZkBSUxE/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">spreadsheet of &#8216;product management&#8217; terms</a>.</p>
	<p>I love the idea of having a quick resource to check unfamiliar (and esoteric) terminology, and when my mentee showed me the spreadsheet, I was instantly reminded of the &#8220;jargon and acronyms&#8221; dictionary that we had back in 2016 when I worked for Amazon.</p>
	<p>To practice discussing pain-points, my mentee and I reviewed her process of discovering and looking up terms and looked for opportunities for improvement.</p>

	<h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
	<p>&#8220;Welcome to the world of software (there&#8217;s a lot to learn).&#8221;</p>
	<p>To scope the problem we wanted to solve, my mentee and I built a list of pain-points:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There&#8217;s a lot to learn and it can be a steep learning curve for new-hires as they learn all of the new jargon and acronyms at once</li>
		<li>Terms don&#8217;t usually mean the same across industries - that adds a lot of &#8220;noise&#8221; to be sifted through, and requires that the person looking up a term has a preexisting concept of what answer they&#8217;re looking for</li>
		<li>Many sources of information are inaccurate, unreliable, or incomplete, and without a clear understanding of the term or concept, it can be difficult to discern which sources are good</li>
		<li>Few comprehensive lists of terms exist, and what lists do exist are seldom organized systematically</li>
		<li>Definitions aren&#8217;t available without a somewhat-exhaustive search to both source and verify definitions</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The pain-points were then distilled down to these simple statements</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There are hundreds of new terms and concepts for new-hires to learn</li>
		<li>Searching the Internet produces mixed or unhelpful results</li>
		<li>The information on the Internet is often inaccurate, conflicting, or out-of-date</li>
		<li>Most software acronyms are too esoteric or &#8216;overloaded&#8217; to look up</li>
		<li>It&#8217;s difficult to find related resources for broad concepts</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We also produced a list of pain-points specific to using the spreadsheet:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The spreadsheet is slow to load (because it&#8217;s dependent on Google Docs)</li>
		<li>Using the spreadsheet is error-prone (it&#8217;s too easy to accidentally make changes)</li>
		<li>Accessing the spreadsheet requires an Internet connection</li>
		<li>It&#8217;s unclear how to request revisions (or whether updates will be made)</li>
		<li>Using the included resource-links is cumbersome (links require many clicks to open)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
	<p>&#8220;Learning about software and the design-development process generally requires a foundational knowledge of the disciplines to understand the information in context. While information is plentiful on the internet, searching for explanations of unfamiliar terms is time-consuming, unreliable, and often distracting.&#8221;</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Goal</h2>
	<p>&#8220;We intend to address the challenges of prerequisite knowledge and cumbersome, protracted searches for reliable definitions by providing a simple solution to efficiently find the domain-specific definitions of unfamiliar terms explained in plain English.&#8221;</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Research</h2>
	<p>There are relatively few resources for learning about software that are both free and reliable. The simplest solutions like online-spreadsheets are easy to share, but difficult to use. The alternatives tend to be pay-walled websites that might have more reliable information, but at a cost of money and accessibility.</p>

	<h2>UI
		<div class="image-alert">Click any image to zoom</div>
	</h2>
	<div class="gallery"><img src="../images/dictionary/dictionary-original.png" alt="Dictionary UI Original" /><img src="../images/dictionary/dictionary-improved.png" alt="Dictionary UI Improved" /><span>(click to expand)</span><span class="collapse"><i class="fa fa-times"></i> collapse</span></div>
	<p>Dictionary entries have no default styling. The goal was to create entries that look good but aren&#8217;t distracting.</p>
	<p>One benefit of cleaning up the typography was that we realized that there was an opportunity to add linked terms to reduce redundancy and improve the &#8220;quality of life&#8221; for users.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Future Development</h2>
	<p>We hope to bring the dictionary to more devices -- targeting iOS is our next goal. (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/132600" target="_blank">Hopefully we&#8217;ll get an answer soon</a>)</p>
	<p>The dictionary will be even more useful if it can download new terms and periodically check for updates like the built-in dictionaries can. We hope to either support retrieving definitions from an online source or build-in automatic update-tracking in a future enhancement.</p>
