	<h2>Shopping in an Instant</h2>
	<div class="flex-container 3-col outline">
		<div>
			<h3>Opportunity</h3>
			<p>Customers visiting a &lsquo;Campus Pickup Point&rsquo; are idle for a short time awaiting their package.</p>
			<p>Students visiting may want to buy a snack or pick up school supplies on their way to class.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p>Empower customers to instantly buy any of over 2,000 curated items.</p>
			<p>IA should facilitate organic discovery, learn-ability of categories, and location-specific product offerings.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
			<p>Amazon is not &lsquo;shop&rsquo;-able:</p>
			<p>From redundant listings to miscategorized products and a taxonomy reflecting business-units instead of the ways people shop and buy, customers can&rsquo;t browse for products.</p>

	<h2 id="testing-1">Testing Round 1:</h2>
	<p>Performing usability testing on the UI, I observed that although participants were able to complete our &lsquo;happy path&rsquo; tasks, many of the participants were noticeably hesitant to browse for products.</p>
	<p>We started the usability tests with a disclaimer &ldquo;we&rsquo;re testing a new idea: if it&rsquo;s difficult or confusing, that&rsquo;s a sign that we still need to improve our design&rdquo;, but participants were still noticeably hesitant as they browsed.</p>
	<p>Observing them, where we hoped they would be excited to explore, but instead it felt like they were afraid of choosing the wrong categories.</p>
	<p>My intuition told me it would be difficult for customers to learn the taxonomy, and the way the UI was designed, there was too little information scent to encourage discovery.</p>

	<h2 id="inflection-point">Inflection Point</h2>
	<p>Before I could as for a change, I&rsquo;d need to make a compelling argument case, and that meant tearing down the current solution and offering up something better.</p>

		<p>The dream of offering products that customers could &ldquo;Grab and go&rdquo; meant that we needed to not-only offer products that conformed to that use-case, but we needed to unsure that the corresponding components were available.</p>
		<p>You could eat a single GoGurt, but you probably won&rsquo;t want to unless it&rsquo;s refrigerated (<em>even if it <strong>is</strong> &lsquo;shelf-stable&rsquo;</em>).</p>
		<p>By contrast, turning a bag of corn kernels into &lsquo;food&rsquo; is beyond the capacity of most adults I know, let alone students living in dorms.</p>

<figure>
	<h2 id="setting-limits">Setting Limits</h2>
	<p>To keep the taxonomy simple-enough to browse, my boss gave me some arbitrary limits to work within. Knowing that I could push back if I had a good reason, I really appreciated having a set of guidelines to work against.</p>
	<ol class="big no-mark">
		<li>7 top-level categories</li>
		<li>&lt;10 sub-categories in each</li>
		<li>2 layers of nesting</li>
	</ol>

	</picture>
	<figcaption>
		<p>The biggest takeaway for me in this process was learning that taxonomies are 100% context-dependent.</p>
		<p>When products are grouped by use-case, the taxonomy is easier to understand, but it still won&rsquo;t be &lsquo;usable&rsquo; unless the specificity of categories is proportionate to the number of products.</p>
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<section class="flex-container 2-col">
	<div>
		<h2>Eureka!</h2>
		<p>And then it hit me &mdash; there&rsquo;s no hard requirement that products exist in only one category.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bg">
		<p>If I can&rsquo;t find a &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; solution, &ldquo;No problem&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>We can just put every &lsquo;questionable&rsquo; item in every matching category.</p>
		<p>Clearly a polyhierarchy is the way to go.</p>

	<h3>Participant info:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Source:</b> Amazon interns</li>
		<li><b>Gender:</b> 10 male, 10 female</li>
		<li><b>Ages:</b> 18&ndash;24</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Task:</h3>
	<p>Participants used a simple nested-list (in which only one level of the list was visible at a time) to browse for products. Each participant was required to browse for 10 different products (from one of two lists).</p>
	<h3>Success Criteria:</h3>
	<p>Participants were given up to two chances to guess the matching category and sub-category for each product in the list.</p>

		<p>&lsquo;Guaranteed success&rsquo; does not guarantee success, and this failure was both disappointing <em>and embarrassing</em>.</p>
		<p>Although my design performed horribly, by admitting to my failure, I was able to turn my learnings into &lsquo;data-driven&rsquo; guidelines for what-not-to-do when refining, updating, and extending the taxonomy.</p>
		<p>Looking back, (in spite of the embarrassment) I&rsquo;m grateful for how dramatically I&rsquo;d failed. While I might have been able to continue pursuing my design after a minor failure; instead I learned a valuable lesson about &ldquo;the paradox of choice&rdquo;, which has helped me simplify my designs for years.</p>

	<p>Utilizing and refining my draft guidelines as I worked, I conducted 8 additional rounds of tests.</p>
	<p>Amazon&rsquo;s bar of confidence is 95%. It&rsquo;s a lofty goal, but I was confident that I could make it if I kept working.</p>
	<div class="flex-container 3-col steps">
		<div>
			<h3>Open Card-Sort</h3>
			<p>Using the names of 50 products I selected to represent the 2000 on offer, participants sorted cards into categories ranging in size from 3 to 15 items.</p>
			<p><strong>&gt;20</strong> totally-unexpected categories emerged</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Tree Testing</h3>
			<p>Using the dozens of categories generated in the card-sort, I selected the 35 most-distinct labels that covered the broadest swath of items.</p>
			<p><strong>12</strong> participants browsed for <strong>20</strong> of <strong>35</strong> products</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Re-testing</h3>
			<p><strong>5</strong> additional rounds of testing with <strong>6&ndash;10</strong> participants moved us incrementally closer to <strong>95%</strong> confidence.</p>
			<p>Final Round:</p>
			<p><strong>10</strong> participants, <strong>20</strong> items</p>
