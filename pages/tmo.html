	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Even for expert developers, deploying applications to the cloud is messy and complicated; my challenge was to make it feel intuitive and easy.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Starting From Scratch</h2>
	<img class="can-zoom" src="/images/tmo/architecture.png" alt="Conducktor architecture diagram"/>
	<p>I joined T&#8209;Mobile in January of 2018, shortly after the architect completed development of a 'Proof of Concept' for their proposed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) platform.</p>
	<a class="what-is">What is PaaS?</a>
	<p class="def hidden">PaaS allows you to install and run software without having without having to manage any of the details like networking, runtime, operating-system, servers, storage, networking, etc. A nice analogy is the idea of running an app on your phone; PaaS is like your phone operating system in that the phone takes care of power-management, multitasking, etc so that the developers can just focus on building their apps.</p>
	<p>My job was to collaborate with the Architect and the Product Manager to define the road-map and project scope for multiple releases, draft the various data models and relationships necessary to support the platform, define the personas, define the workflows, manage the interface development, and finally to design and support development of the UI.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Building Relationships</h2>
	<div class="gallery"><img src="/images/tmo/requirements-core-ui.png" alt="UI requirements"/><img src="/images/tmo/data-entitlements.png" alt="environmental entitlements"/><img src="/images/tmo/personas.png" alt="personas and permissions"/><span>(click to expand)</span><span class="collapse"><i class="fa fa-times"></i> collapse</span></div>
	<p>Before I could build an interface for our product, I needed to determine what tasks our users would need to complete (fundamentally what our system was supposed to do), and after that, which options or configurations we'd need to support to deliver the corresponding features.</p>
	<p>Because our product was intended for Enterprise-deployment, we needed to support a generic, extensible data model (so other companies building on our platform could define their own 'staging' requirements) and we needed to figure out what data our own team needed in order to approve and promote customer applications from Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to Production.</p>
	<p>Finally, because this is a 'managed' system (with platform administrators, multiple levels of permissions within customer roles, and internal-audit reviewers), I partnered with the architect, stakeholders, and our administrative team to define who our users were and what access they'd need.</p>

<section>
	<h2>Project Impact</h2>
	<p>New User On-boarding time was reduced from 2 months to 1 day. (~97% reduction)</p>
	<p>Additionally, through the development of more accurate, concise, and usable documentation and intake "wizard", support requests were reduced from 2-4 hours per step down to a single 1-hour review session prior to publishing.</p>
	<p>Having a responsive interface that could be used side-by-side while working also accelerated development and improved incident-response times for the core-platform team, and improved architecture-and-design documentation demystified the API and extensibility-configurations for developers of 'add-ons'.</p>
