	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Thrilled with my work on their new font, Adam, the marketing director at Bob Books asked me to make a bid for their next game development contract.</p>
	<p>Adam asked me to create a proposal that would demonstrate other gameplay methods and generally make the games more engaging.</p>
	<p>Over the following month I designed a variety of spelling games; wrote a script; created illustrations, sound effects, and animations; and programmed a game in Unity with my friend Michael Afrides.</p>

	<p>Bob Books&#8217; existing games feature a single gameplay concept and individual spelling challenges. Each level is composed of simple line drawings and lacks any animation or color.</p>
	<p>I believe that by telling a story with the challenges interspersed, the curiosity about story could become the compelling reason for progressing through the levels as opposed to simply completing each challenge for its own sake.</p>

	<p>To win the contract, we would need to show a better UX while also proving that we could reproduce their current gameplay modes.</p>
	<p>The basic gameplay mode required spelling a word in left-to-right order. This is an easy task, so we spiced it up a little with some 3D animations.</p>

	<p>We also wanted to show something new and different that would still be something a young child could accomplish.</p>
	<p>Our second gameplay mode drops &#8220;random&#8221; letters from the top of the screen. To add a little silliness and playfulness, the letters are trapped inside raindrops, which the player has to catch and drop onto sponges to wring out the water.</p>
	<p>We also used this opportunity to create an animated &#8216;cut-scene&#8217; - a feature the existing games don&#8217;t have.</p>

	<p>To create a sense of accomplishment, I wanted each section of our proposed game to feel like an immersive experience with hidden animations and environmental changes that reflect game progress.</p>
	<p>We created a challenge navigation screen (this farm scene) where the rain diminishes and the cats and dogs stop &#8216;raining&#8217; once you save them.</p>
	<p>By the end of the demo the rain has cleared and the scene is pleasant and sunny.</p>

	<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
	<p>In the end the client decided to stick with their overseas developers who work for far less than we were willing to, so we didn&#8217;t get the contract. Although it was disappointing that we weren&#8217;t hired, it was a great experience creating this game from scratch on a new platform, and Michael used his experience here and at his next job to get a full-time game development role.</p>
